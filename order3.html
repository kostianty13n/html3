   <p> 
    <br>    Mmm, yeah! <br>
Tonight, I want to give it all to you <br>
In the darkness, there's so much I want to do <br>
And tonight, I want to lay it at your feet <br>
'Cause girl, I was made for you <br>
And girl, you were made for me <br>
I was made for lovin' you, baby <br>
You were made for lovin' me <br>
And I can't get enough of you, baby <br>
Can you get enough of me? <br>
Tonight, I want to see it in your eyes <br>
Feel the magic, there's something <br>
 that drives me wild <br>
And tonight, we're gonna make it all come true <br>
'Cause girl, you were made for me <br>
And girl, I was made for you <br>
I was made for lovin' you, baby <br>
You were made for lovin' me <br>
And I can't get enough of you, baby <br>
Can you get enough of me? <br>
I was made for lovin' you, baby <br>
You were made for lovin' me <br>
And I can give it all to you, baby <br>
Can you give it all to me? <br>
Oh, can't get enough <br>
I can't get enough <br>
I can't get enough <br>
I was made for lovin' you, baby <br>
You were made for lovin' me <br>
And I can't get enough of you, baby <br>
Can you get enough of me? <br>
Oh, I was made <br>
You were made <br>
I can't get enough <br>
No, I can't get enough <br>
I was made for lovin' you, baby <br>
You were made for lovin' me <br>
And I can't get enough of you, baby <br>
Can you get enough of me? </p>

 "I Was Made for Lovin' You" draws heavily from the disco style that was popular in late-1970s United States. Paul Stanley, who co-wrote the song with Desmond Child and Vini Poncia, has stated that it was a conscious effort on his part to prove how easy it was to write and record a hit disco song.[6]

                    William Blake,
                     ‘Spring‘.
   Sound the flute!
   Now it’s mute!

           Bird’s delight,
              Day and night,
     Nightingale,
        In the dale,
    Lark in sky,—
 Merrily,
      Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year…   
     </pre>
